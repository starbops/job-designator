# job-designator

Randomly dispatch jobs, with weighted feature :grin:

## Usage

Get help:

`$ jober -h`

Add or modify user (with weight specified, default is 1) into the list:

`$ jober -u <user> [-w <weight>]`

Remove users into the list:

`$ jober -d <user>`

Give me some guys with bad luck (truly randomness):

`$ jober -c <number>`

Give me some guys with bad luck, weight matters :smiling_imp:

`$ jober -c <number> -e
